Transfer Learning for NLP with TensorFlow Hub

## Overview

[TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/) is a repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.

Τhis project, will use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub with [`tf.keras`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) for text classification. Transfer learning makes it possible to save training resources and to achieve good model generalization even when training on a small dataset. Τhis project, will demonstrate this by training with several different TF-Hub modules.

## Methodology 
- Use various pre-trained NLP text embedding models from TensorFlow Hub
- Perform transfer learning to fine-tune models on our own text data
- Visualize model performance metrics with [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
  

## Installation
The program is in Python <br />
